# Animes Page Owners

> **ðŸ“‹ Project Ownership Vision**: This OWNERS file represents the approach to scalable project management. As the project grows and different features/modules are developed, each section will have designated owners who are responsible for that specific area. This ensures clear accountability, faster decision-making, and better code quality through specialized expertise. Think of it as "micro-teams" within the larger project structure.
